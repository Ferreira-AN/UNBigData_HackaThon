# Country diet quality forecast from socio-economic data
The purpose of this work is to find which variables, besides the own diet measurements, can strongly influence how healthy are the country meals.

## Process
Our process on discovering a solution for this problem is described below:

1. Find nutrition and relevant socio-economic datasets
2. Find a target metric that scores how healthy is a country's food
3. Select the most relevant features avoiding multicolinearity
4. Build a model that can forecast the metric and explain the features weight
5. Visualize the features impact and the error

## Datasets
